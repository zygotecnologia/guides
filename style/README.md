Style
=====

This repository was created to document the style guidelines of our tech development stack.

Our purpose is to define a standard way to write code in a clear and semantic form. We care a lot with code legibility and always worried if other developers will understand easily what we're doing.

The entire team should contribute with this repo, giving suggestions and making changes on it, you're welcome!

We have the following more detailed style guides:

* [Ruby](ruby)
* [Git](git)
